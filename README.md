🌀 Obliquities (OBES) White Paper

The Less You Understand, the More You’re In.

⸻

TL;DR

Obliquities meme coin for those who know better than to believe anything they read — including this. Built on Base, powered by irony, and governed by chaos, OBED is a social experiment in ambiguous value, memetic virality, and the absurdist beauty of the crypto degenerate mind.

⸻

🧬 What Is OBES?

Obliquities are not here to solve problems. It is the problem — and the solution. OBES is a meme coin for people who have stopped asking “what does it do?” and started asking “how confused can we make the SEC?”

It is:
	•	A coin without a cause
	•	A movement without a mission
	•	A vibe without validation
